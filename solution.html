							<p>The challenge for home-based devices is to minimize unnecessary clinical consultation while not missing the opportunity to intervene if the unborn baby is at risk. There is no reliable way to assess a baby's heart rate at home except with a home-used consumer ultrasound Doppler fetal heart rate device that is notorious in difficulty to find the fetal heart beats, often causing even more alarm to the other. Therefore, we introduce the Nemo belt â€“ a wearable device for remote fetal and maternal health monitoring. The belt provides continuous heart rate monitoring during the development of fetus from 2nd trimester to 3rd trimester of pregnancy, enabling providers to conduct virtual well-being checks with expectant moms from anywhere. Compared with the other inventions shown in the Appendix X1, two distinct differences come from the non-contact sensing technology [cite] and data processing algorithm [cite]. Our team has developed several prototypes and had a pilot study on human subjects at UC, Irvine medical center. The detail of product development is described in the Appendix X2. The Nemo belt is under preparation to file a patent with the ownership of University of California.
