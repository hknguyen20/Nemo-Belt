							<h2>Target Market</h2>
							<p>Our market is <b>Vietnam</b>, a developing country in SouthEast Asia with the number of women in childbearing age (15-49 years old) is over 24.2 million (out of 96.2 million total population). Our customers are  hospitals in Vietnam (mainly in big cities) and pregnant women and pregnant women from the age of 17 to 49, especially those who are  high-risk pregnancy such as older women, women who are pregnant for the first time, and having medical conditions.</p>
							<p>In 2020, over 1000 Vietnamese infants, 16.7 of them died [6]. This not only affects the mental but also the physical health of mothers as well as socio-economic development indicators. Moreover, in rural areas, the lack of doctors and medical infrastructure makes pregnant women tend to skip check-ups, wait longer and travel further to see a doctor. </p>
							<p>We have conducted qualitative research with 10 pregnant mothers who visit the Hanoi Obstetrics and Gynecology hospital for antenatal contacts. Inclusion criteria include age over 18 years old and not a high-risk pregnancy defined by obstetrics. 100% of them answered that they found it was easy to use. 90% of them were willing to have another trial and interviews in the future as well as 100% were interested in having this product at home.</p>
							<p>In Vietnam, there are no products using the same technology in counting the infantsâ€™ heartbeat. With the Nemo Belt, the abdominal signals are collected by a wearable belt, and then the collected data are sent to the Android app via Bluetooth Low Energy communication. This information would be sent and stored for further analysis. </p>
							<h2>Market Strategies</h2>
							<p>Our commercialization plan will go through two main streams.
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li><b>Business to Business (B2B)</b>: Cooperate with hospitals.</li>
								Hospitals will help us to sell the products to customers and we earn commission. Moreover, this product can assist doctors in shortening check-up procedures and we could earn revenue by hospitals as our customers. 
								<li><b>Business to Customer (B2C)</b>: Sell or loan the product directly to our customer.</li>
							</ol>
